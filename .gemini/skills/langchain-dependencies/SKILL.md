# Langchain Dependencies

The LangChain ecosystem is split into focused, independently-versioned packages. Understanding which packages you need — and their version constraints — prevents incompatibilities and keeps upgrades predictable.

**Key principles:**
- **LangChain 1.0 is the current LTS release.** Always start new projects on 1.0+. LangChain 0.3 is legacy maintenance-only — do not use it for new work.
- **langchain-core** is the shared foundation: always install it explicitly alongside any other package.
- **langchain-community** (Python only) does NOT follow semantic versioning; pin it conservatively.
- **LangGraph vs Deep Agents:** choose one orchestration approach based on your use case — they are alternatives, not a required stack (see [Framework Choice](#framework-choice) below).
- Provider integrations (model, vector store, tools) are installed separately so you only pull in what you use.

## Environment Requirements



| Requirement | Python | TypeScript / Node |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Runtime minimum | **Python 3.10+** | **Node.js 20+** |
| LangChain | **1.0+ (LTS)** | **1.0+ (LTS)** |
| LangSmith SDK | >= 0.3.0 | >= 0.3.0 |



---

## Framework Choice


Pick **one** agent orchestration layer. You do not need both.

| Framework | When to use | Core extra package |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------|
| **LangGraph** | Need fine-grained graph control, custom workflows, loops, or branching | `langgraph` / `@langchain/langgraph` |
| **Deep Agents** | Want batteries-included planning, memory, file context, and skills out of the box | `deepagents` (depends on LangGraph; installs it as a transitive dep) |

Both sit on top of `langchain` + `langchain-core` + `langsmith`.


---

## Core Packages



### Python — always required

| Package | Role | Min version |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `langchain` | Agents, chains, retrieval | 1.0 |
| `langchain-core` | Base types & interfaces (peer dep) | 1.0 |
| `langsmith` | Tracing, evaluation, datasets | 0.3.0 |

### Python — orchestration (pick one)

| Package | Use when | Min version |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `langgraph` | Building custom graphs directly | 1.0 |
| `deepagents` | Using the Deep Agents framework | latest |

### Python — model providers (pick the one(s) you use)

| Package | Provider |
|---------|----------|
| `langchain-openai` | OpenAI (GPT-4o, o3, …) |
| `langchain-anthropic` | Anthropic (Claude) |
| `langchain-google-genai` | Google (Gemini) |
| `langchain-mistralai` | Mistral |
| `langchain-groq` | Groq (fast inference) |
| `langchain-cohere` | Cohere |
| `langchain-fireworks` | Fireworks AI |
| `langchain-together` | Together AI |
| `langchain-huggingface` | Hugging Face Hub |
| `langchain-ollama` | Ollama (local models) |
| `langchain-aws` | AWS Bedrock |
| `langchain-azure-ai` | Azure AI Foundry |

### Python — common tool & retrieval packages

These packages have tighter compatibility requirements — use the latest available version unless you have a specific reason not to.

| Package | Adds | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| `langchain-tavily` | Tavily web search (`TavilySearch`) | Dedicated integration package; prefer latest |
| `langchain-text-splitters` | Text chunking utilities | Semver, keep current |
| `langchain-community` | 1000+ integrations (fallback) | **NOT semver — pin to minor series** |
| `faiss-cpu` | FAISS vector store (local) | Via `langchain-community`; use latest |
| `langchain-chroma` | Chroma vector store | Dedicated integration package; prefer latest |
| `langchain-pinecone` | Pinecone vector store | Dedicated integration package; prefer latest |
| `langchain-qdrant` | Qdrant vector store | Dedicated integration package; prefer latest |
| `langchain-weaviate` | Weaviate vector store | Dedicated integration package; prefer latest |
| `langsmith[pytest]` | pytest plugin for LangSmith | Requires langsmith >= 0.3.4 |

> **langchain-community stability note:** This package is NOT on semantic versioning. Minor releases can contain breaking changes. Prefer dedicated integration packages (e.g. `langchain-chroma`, `langchain-tavily`) when they exist — they are independently versioned and more stable.





### TypeScript — always required

| Package | Role | Min version |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `@langchain/core` | Base types & interfaces (peer dep) | 1.0 |
| `langchain` | Agents, chains, retrieval | 1.0 |
| `langsmith` | Tracing, evaluation, datasets | 0.3.0 |

### TypeScript — orchestration (pick one)

| Package | Use when | Min version |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `@langchain/langgraph` | Building custom graphs directly | 1.0 |
| `deepagents` | Using the Deep Agents framework | latest |

### TypeScript — model providers (pick the one(s) you use)

| Package | Provider |
|---------|----------|
| `@langchain/openai` | OpenAI (GPT-4o, o3, …) |
| `@langchain/anthropic` | Anthropic (Claude) |
| `@langchain/google-genai` | Google (Gemini) |
| `@langchain/mistralai` | Mistral |
| `@langchain/groq` | Groq (fast inference) |
| `@langchain/cohere` | Cohere |
| `@langchain/aws` | AWS Bedrock |
| `@langchain/azure-openai` | Azure OpenAI |
| `@langchain/ollama` | Ollama (local models) |

### TypeScript — common tool & retrieval packages

| Package | Adds | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| `@langchain/tavily` | Tavily web search (`TavilySearch`) | Dedicated integration package; prefer latest |
| `@langchain/community` | Broad set of community integrations | Use sparingly; prefer dedicated packages |
| `@langchain/pinecone` | Pinecone vector store | Dedicated integration package; prefer latest |
| `@langchain/qdrant` | Qdrant vector store | Dedicated integration package; prefer latest |
| `@langchain/weaviate` | Weaviate vector store | Dedicated integration package; prefer latest |

> **`@langchain/core` must be installed explicitly** in yarn workspaces and monorepos — it is a peer dependency and will not always be hoisted automatically.

## Versioning Policy & Upgrade Strategy



| Package group | Versioning | Safe upgrade strategy |
|---------------|------------|-----------------------|
| `langchain`, `langchain-core` | Strict semver (1.0 LTS) | Allow minor: `>=1.0,<2.0` |
| `langgraph` / `@langchain/langgraph` | Strict semver (v1 LTS) | Allow minor: `>=1.0,<2.0` |
| `langsmith` | Strict semver | Allow minor: `>=0.3.0` |
| Dedicated integration packages (e.g. `langchain-tavily`, `langchain-chroma`) | Independently versioned | Allow minor updates; use latest |
| `langchain-community` | **NOT semver** | Pin exact minor: `>=0.4.0,<0.5.0` |
| `deepagents` | Follow project releases | Pin to tested version in production |

**Breaking changes only happen in major versions** (1.x → 2.x) for all semver-compliant packages. Deprecated features remain functional across the entire 1.x series with warnings.

**Prefer dedicated integration packages over langchain-community.** When a dedicated package exists (e.g. `langchain-chroma` instead of `langchain-community`'s Chroma integration), use it — dedicated packages are independently versioned and better tested.

**Community tool packages (Tavily, vector stores, etc.) should be kept at latest** unless your project requires a locked environment. These packages frequently release compatibility fixes alongside LangChain/LangGraph updates.

## Environment Variables


All keys are read from the environment at runtime. Set only the keys for services you actually use.

```bash
# LangSmith (always recommended for observability)
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=   # optional, defaults to "default"

# Model provider — set the one(s) you use
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
MISTRAL_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
COHERE_API_KEY=
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=
TOGETHER_API_KEY=
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=

# Common tool/retrieval services
TAVILY_API_KEY=          # for Tavily search
PINECONE_API_KEY=        # for Pinecone
```

## Common Mistakes


Never start a new project on LangChain 0.3. It is maintenance-only until December 2026.
```
# WRONG: legacy, no new features, security patches only
langchain>=0.3,<0.4

# CORRECT: LangChain 1.0 LTS
langchain>=1.0,<2.0
```



`langchain-community` can break on minor version bumps — it does not follow semver.
```
# WRONG: allows minor-version updates that may be breaking
langchain-community>=0.4

# CORRECT: pin to exact minor series
langchain-community>=0.4.0,<0.5.0
```
Also consider switching to the equivalent dedicated integration package if one exists (e.g. `langchain-chroma` instead of the community Chroma integration).



Community tool packages like `langchain-tavily` and vector store integrations release compatibility fixes alongside LangChain updates. Using an old pinned version can cause import errors or broken tool schemas.
```
# RISKY: old pin may be incompatible with LangChain 1.0
langchain-tavily==0.0.1

# BETTER: allow latest within the current major
langchain-tavily>=0.1
```



Many tools that used to live in `langchain-community` now have dedicated packages with updated import paths. Always prefer the dedicated package import.

```python
# WRONG — deprecated community import path
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_community.tools import WikipediaQueryRun
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Pinecone

# CORRECT — use dedicated package imports
from langchain_tavily import TavilySearch                  # pip: langchain-tavily (TavilySearchResults is deprecated)
from langchain_community.tools import WikipediaQueryRun  # no dedicated pkg yet
from langchain_chroma import Chroma                       # pip: langchain-chroma
from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore        # pip: langchain-pinecone
```

To find the current canonical import for any integration, search the integrations directory:
https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/

Each entry shows the correct package and import path. If a dedicated package exists, use it — the community path may still work but is considered legacy.




`@langchain/core` is a peer dependency — it must be in your package.json, especially in monorepos.
```json
// WRONG: missing @langchain/core (breaks in yarn workspaces / strict hoisting)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@langchain/langgraph": "^1.0.0"
  }
}

// CORRECT: always list @langchain/core explicitly
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@langchain/core": "^1.0.0",
    "@langchain/langgraph": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```





Python 3.9 and below are not supported by LangChain 1.0.
```python
# Verify before installing
import sys
assert sys.version_info >= (3, 10), "Python 3.10+ required for LangChain 1.0"
```





Node.js below 20 is not officially supported.
```bash
# Verify before installing
node --version   # must be v20.x or higher
```
